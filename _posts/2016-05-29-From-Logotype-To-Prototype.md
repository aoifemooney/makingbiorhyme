The difference between a logotype and a typeface is similar to the difference between lettering and type. Lettering is a context-specific set of letterforms designed to work in only one form and sequence and to form a particular word shape. Type is an industrial product. A mass-produced and mass-produceable set of components designed to work together and in combination in an endless variety of configurations. In the same vein, a logotype is something that exists in contextual perpetuity. It consists of a set of shapes designed to work harmoniously together, and in the same pattern. Its requirement for legibility is at the level of the word, and so often liberties will be taken with the relationship between the forms, with some letters looping around others, creating ligatures, or similar letterforms conceived of with alternate structures to create interest and difference within the form of the word but importantly, without disrupting it. The letters in a logotype have a requirement to space well to their neighbors, and there is no requirement for these letters to function in a repeating system. This concern begins only with the separation of the parts of the whole into discrete modules for reuse and recombination for use in a typeface. Typefaces are systems of shapes and behaviors of shapesâ€”a sort of form language built out of smaller micro decisions. Each decision is woven into a pattern of behaviors for stroke endings, stem/bowl connections, weight distribution, angle of stress, counter size, proportions etc. to create the textura of the paragraph. Textura is the Latin word for fabric, and the name of the first types. It denotes the aim for consistency and evenness of color in typography that is built out of a carefully maintained relationship between the parts of the letterforms, and the spaces between them.
