Hello!

Welcome to Making BioRhyme. BioRhyme is a typeface family developed from a logotype. This blog is intended to document the process of translating a piece of lettering inspiration into context-specific lettering and building ultimately into the system of shapes necessary for a functioning typeface.
Here we will be expanding on the development of only two styles of a typeface in a deliberate attempt to focus the discussion while also incorporating enough variables to be informative and a useful resource for those designers wishing to develop their own typefaces.

In describing the process of making BioRhyme in the weeks and months (!) that follow, I will aim to articulate some of the design decisions and conceptual considerations in any typeface design project, and provide technical know-how as part of the narrative structure, rather than providing a simple tech-tutorial, for which there are already many existing resources. With this in mind, where useful, I will provide references and links to other useful content to supplement the content provided here.

About me: I’m an independent typeface designer and Assistant Professor at Kent State University, Ohio, USA. I have an MA from the University of Reading, and cut my teeth as a working typeface designer at the Hoefler & Frere-Jones type foundry in NYC, before leaving for OH, where there is a lot of corn and some great beer and running trails. Nice to meet you.
