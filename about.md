This project is housed on GitHub and is possible thanks to financial support from [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts).

### Font Specifics
* slab serif, monoline
* extended & regular cuts for display and text on screen
* based on an R from the Conner's type foundry specimen & ATF's Boston Breton
* supports Central and Western European languages only
* Kannada, Tamil and Gujarati extensions in the works by other designers (watch this space)

### About your host
Aoife is a Typo/Graphic designer and Assistant Professor at Kent State University, OH. Having graduated with an MA in Typeface Design from the University of Reading (UK) in 2010, she moved to become a typeface designer for the NYC based type foundry Hoefler & Co. (Previously Hoefler & Frere-Jones). In 2014, she moved to Ohio, where she continues to work as a freelance typeface designer, graphic designer and teacher.

### Future plans
In order to facilitate easy dissemination and distribution of content to document the development of these two styles, at present, BioRhyme is a small family, but it is my intention to build this out, and indeed if you look in the Glyphs files in GitHub you will see instances and masters set up for interpolation of other weights and widths. For now though, this is just a limited release focused on the process rather than the product.
