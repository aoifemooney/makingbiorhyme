As of 2016_04_30, BioRhyme is a display typeface family, intended to work as a set of related but standalone expressive styles for use at larger sizes. It is comprised of two widths and five weights and is supports the Latin 3 character set. 
	Defined by its exaggerated slab serifs, slow curves and playful quirks, BioRhyme comes with a range of alternates to facilitate amping up its quirks where appropriate, while its low contrast allows it to be a functional and readable typeface in short paragraph setting. 
	Its design is an amalgamation of influences including ATFâ€™s 1912 Boston Breton and taking cues from American Typewriter and Archer in its lighter weights, and Clarendon and Rockwell in its blunt slabs and bold weight. 

Two distinct typefaces have also been designed to complement BioRhyme ExtraLight Expanded for multilingual setting. Padyakke is a Kannada typeface designed by James Puckett of Dunwich Type Foundry (www.dunwichtype.com) and BhuTuka is a Gurmukhi typeface designed by Erin McLaughlin (www.hindirinny.com). Both of these typefaces have been designed to accompany only the ExtraLight Expanded style of BioRhyme. If you are interested in funding the development of more Padyakke fonts please email James at <padyakkefonts@gmail.com>, or for more BhuTuka fonts, please email Erin at <hello@erinmclaughlin.com>

BioRhyme's TrueType format font files are autohinted using a combination of the GlyphsApp autohint settings and TTFAutohint (www.freetype.org/ttfautohint).  Since this typeface is designed for large and medium-size text-setting, it is not manually hinted for smaller sizes at this time.
