The *Tufte-Jekyll* theme is a natural extension of the work done by [Dave Leipmann](https://github.com/daveliepmann/tufte-css) on Github that created a CSS file that allows web writers to use the simple and elegant style employed by Edward Tufte in his published materials.

To incorporate these styles into a Jekyll theme, I have made some very slight modifications that attempt to maintain the feel of the CSS styles in this repo.

You can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
