# Padyakke Libre

Padyakke is a Kannada typeface developed by James Puckett of Dunwich Type Founders. Official source files and compiled fonts are released at: https://github.com/DunwichType/Padyakke_Libre

Dunwich Type Founders cares what you think! Please file issues on the Github project issue tracker, at https://github.com/DunwichType/Padyakke_Libre/issues or contact me privately at padyakkefonts@gmail.com.

At this time only a thin wide font has been developed. Additional widths and weights will be created if a client commissions their development. If you are interested in funding the development of more Padyakke fonts please email me at padyakkefonts@gmail.com.

I think Padyakke is the first light wide Kannada typeface. Padyakkeâ€™s shapes and proportions were developed by analyzing Adobe Kannada and Noto Kannada.

The TrueType Padyakke font is manually hinted. It was hinted with Glyphs and hints are in the source file (Padyakke.glyphs)

Padyakke is intended to pair with BioRhyme by Aoife Mooney https://github.com/aoifemooney/makingbiorhyme. Latin glyphs were taken directly from version 36 of BioRhyme. They will probably be replaced with the final versions of the BioRhyme glyphs after it is released.

Source files for Kannada PDF proofs are in the Dunwich Type proofs repository: https://github.com/DunwichType/DTF_Proofs

Padyakke was developed with Glyphs 2. Glyphs 2 can be found at http://www.glyphsapp.com.

Padyakke contains data from BioRhyme by Aoife Mooney. BioRhyme can be found at: https://github.com/aoifemooney/makingbiorhyme

Padyakke contains data from Hind Mysuru by Indian Type Foundry. Hind Mysuru can be found at: https://github.com/itfoundry/hind-mysuru
