# BioRhyme Libre

BioRhyme is a Latin 3 typeface developed by Aoife Mooney. The official source files and compiled fonts are released at: https://github.com/aoifemooney/makingbiorhyme

Please file issues on the Github project issue tracker, at https://github.com/AoifeMooney/BioRhyme/issues or contact me privately at <aoifemooney@gmail.com>

As of 2016_03_09, BioRhyme is comprised of two widths — a regular and an expanded — and 5 weights for each. The family supports the Latin 3 character set. 

Two distinct typefaces have also been designed to complement BioRhyme Extra-Light Expanded for multilingual setting. Padyakke is a Kannada typeface designed by James Puckett of Dunwich Type Foundry (www.dunwichtype.com) and BhuTuka is a Gurmukhi typeface designed by Erin McLaughlin (www.hindirinny.com). Both of these typefaces have been designed to accompany only the Extra-Light Expanded style of BioRhyme. If you are interested in funding the development of more Padyakke fonts please email James at <padyakkefonts@gmail.com>, or for more BhuTuka fonts, please email Erin at <hello@erinmclaughlin.com>

BioRhyme's TrueType format font files are autohinted using a combination of the GlyphsApp autohint settings and TTFAutohint (http://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/).  Since this typeface is designed for large and medium-size text-setting, it is not manually hinted for smaller sizes at this time.

Source files for BioRhyme's PDF proofs are located at https://github.com/aoifemooney/makingbiorhyme/Development/Proofs/

BioRhyme was developed with Glyphs 2. Glyphs 2 can be found at http://www.glyphsapp.com.
