Currently, BioRhymeâ€™s naming tables do not seem to behave correctly in Microsoft Office, with the menu sorting excluding the Extra Bold and Extrabold Expanded styles. This appears to be a bug in the current version of Glyphs, and as soon as this is resolved, BioRhyme will be rebuilt and re-released.
