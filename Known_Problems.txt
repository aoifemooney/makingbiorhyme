\f0\fs24 \cf0 Currently, BioRhyme\'92s naming tables do not seem to behave correctly in Microsoft Office, with the menu sorting excluding the Extra Bold and Extrabold Expanded styles. This appears to be a bug in the current version of Glyphs, and as soon as this is resolved, BioRhyme will be rebuilt and re-released.}
